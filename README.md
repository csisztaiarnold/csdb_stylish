## Known issues
- Quotes which are quoted by clicking on the "quote" button in the forum couldn't be styled (only the hr under them)
- On the latest forum posts page, there is an nbsp entity before the poster's handle which cant be removed, so the text couldn't be aligned vertically to the top
- Image inputs can't be replaced
- Works fine only when logged in (some selectors won't point to the same elements in logged out status)

## Todo
- Form styling
- Userpage
- Advanced search
- Test in Firefox and IE
